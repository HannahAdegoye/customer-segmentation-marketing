# customer-segmentation-marketing
The aim of this project is to analysing customer data to gain valuable insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and needs. By leveraging techniques such as data exploration, clustering algorithms, and machine learning models, I will segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographics, purchase history, and online behaviour.
