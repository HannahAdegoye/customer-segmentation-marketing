# Customer Segmentation and Targeted Marketing

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze customer data and leverage techniques such as clustering algorithms and machine learning models to segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographics, purchase history, and online behavior. By understanding these segments, we can develop targeted marketing strategies, including personalized product recommendations and tailored promotional campaigns.

## Project Objectives

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify distinct customer segments using clustering techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering.
2. **Targeted Marketing Strategies**: Develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment, including personalized recommendations and promotional campaigns.
3. **Campaign Evaluation**: Implement A/B testing and analytical techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted marketing campaigns.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights from customer segmentation and targeted marketing analyses.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing customer information, such as demographics, purchase history, and online behavior. The dataset is available in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, identify missing values, and gain initial insights into customer behavior.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behavior patterns.
4. **Targeted Marketing Strategies**: Develop targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment, including personalized product recommendations and tailored promotional campaigns.
5. **Campaign Evaluation**: Implement A/B testing or other analytical techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted marketing campaigns, measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer engagement and conversion rates.
6. **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to communicate findings and insights from customer segmentation and targeted marketing analyses.
